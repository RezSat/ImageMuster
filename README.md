Image Muster, is just a simple game like thing to enter cheques,

basically trying to simulate a little bit of my work during the time that I worked in a bank's corporate branch-clearing unit as a trainee.

I did quite few things there but mainly my tasks was to enter cheques, "enter cheques" might not make any sense for some so don't really bother.

this is just a joke ! but it works.

The idea credited to my friend there, he one day told me what if we create a game so that anyone can enter cheques and earn some money so that we don't have to work, yep its a dumb idea to used in real life but making a game isn't, well this isn't what he fully imagined but I easily get bored so yeah you get this instead.
